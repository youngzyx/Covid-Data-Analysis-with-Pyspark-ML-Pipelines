## Dataset
Both of the datasets are from the CDC. 
* [Dataset1](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4): COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data with Geography
This patient-level dataset includes demographics and geography features such as sex, ethnicity, exposure history, county and state of residence, death or not, etc. 

 
* [Dataset2](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh): COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States by County
Dataset 2 is a aggregated data that includes covid-19 vaccine administration and vaccine equity data at county level.



## Data Pre-processing
Build an ETL pipeline for data pre-processing:
* Covid Data: Drop records with unknown status of death
* Vaccination Data: Group data to month level and count number of vaccinated
* Merged two datasets: Merge covid and vaccination data by year-month, state and county.

  * Execution Time: 0.46s
  * Cluster : 8 Node i3.xlarge cluster with 9.1 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.1.2, Scala 2.12)

## Analytical Goals
* Predict the probability of death of patients
* Predict the amount of Covid death with time series model
* Predict the cumulative vaccinated population with time series model

## Implementation
### Analytical Goal #1: Predict the patients' fatality rate
We used four different models to predict the probability of death of patients:

| Model | Accuracy | Area under ROC | Area under PR | F1 | Execution Time |
| :---- | :-----:  | :-----------:  | :----------:  | :---:  | --------:  |
| Logistic Regression| 0.945 | 0.908 | 0.563 | 0.932 | 12.77 sec |
| Decision Tree | 0.935 | 0.526 | 0.306 | 0.925 | 4.63 sec | 
| Random Forest | 0.946 | 0.910 | 0.573 | 0.930 | 15.69 sec | 
| K-means | 0.812|  - | - | - | 2.59 sec|

### Analytical Goal #2: Predict Amount of death cause by Covid-19 with time series model
* Prediction plot
The time series data is non-stationary, which shows a large volume of fluctuations. The main reason is very likely to be the random occurrence of the virus mutations. As a result, the time series model works poorly in long run.

### Analytical Goal #3: Predicting the cumulative vaccinated population with time series model 
Fitted an additive time series model on the two-year vaccinated data and predicted for the next 5 days. We obtained the predicting result that the trend will be linearly increasing over date and will reach 2.12 billion on Feb 6.

## Conclusion
* ML Model:
   * ML models can be implemented to predict probability of death of a patient.
   * The Random Forest model shows a best performance and least execution time compared to Decision Tree, Logistic Model and K-means. 
* Time Series Model:
   * Time series model can help to forecast infected/vaccinated amount in the future.
   * Time series model works well on fitting overall trend and short-time prediction. However bias may increase in long term run.
